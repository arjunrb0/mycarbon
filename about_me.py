# Section 1: The Importance of Carbon Calculation
st.header("Why Calculate Your Carbon Footprint?")
st.write("""
    Carbon footprint refers to the total amount of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), that are emitted by human activities. This includes energy usage, travel, waste, and more. 
    By understanding the impact of your actions, you can make informed decisions to reduce your emissions and contribute to a more sustainable future.
    
    **Why it's important:**
    - **Environmental impact:** Carbon emissions contribute to global warming, which leads to rising sea levels, more frequent storms, and habitat loss.
    - **Personal responsibility:** Understanding how your lifestyle choices affect the environment helps you take control of your carbon footprint.
    - **Informed decisions:** From reducing energy consumption to optimizing transportation methods, knowing your carbon footprint can guide your decisions toward a more sustainable lifestyle.
