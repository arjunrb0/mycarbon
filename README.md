# Project Portfolio: MyCarbon ‚Äì Personal Carbon Footprint Calculator

My goal is to create an application that allows individuals to calculate their personal carbon footprint through data they enter about their transportation, energy consumption, dietary habits, land use and utility. Each of these factors has an influence on our overall carbon output, and by integrating them into a single web application, I provide a medium for individuals to understand and reduce their carbon footprint. My project also allows the individuals to take a record of their carbon footprint, divided into categories and represented in a tabular, pie chart and a dial chart form. This allows users to quickly and easily understand their individual carbon footprint, making it user friendly. Integrating graphs into my product allows users to develop visual thinking, whereby the learner comes to understand and retain information better by the use of a dial chart, pie chart and a table.

| Tool/Language | Purpose                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Python        | Backend logic & calculations    |

# Future Upgrades (Planned)
- Add more personalized tips and recommendations
- Session saving / Better PDF report exports
- Geo-aware emission tips based on user location
- Gamification (badges, weekly targets)

# Libraries Used
My code employs many libraries such as:
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly.express
- Datetime
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- BytesI0
- os
- NamedTemporaryFile
- Kaleido
- plotly.graph_objects.

This project helped me connect my interests in environmental science, mathematics, and computer programming. I learned how to build a complete application from scratch, starting from research to deployment. It also improved my problem-solving mindset ‚Äî balancing simplicity, accuracy, and usability. As I move into the IB Diploma Program with HL subjects in Math, Physics, and Chemistry, I plan to keep refining this app and use it as the foundation for extended essays or further technical projects.
